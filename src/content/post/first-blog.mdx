## Hello World

So I'm starting a blog. Really I'm doing this to get some more development skills, and I thought it would be nice to have a record of all the random weird projects I do. This blog may be full of anything really, I haven't decided, but currently I've been doing a lot of 3d printing and various electronics projects. I've been slowly learning to 3d model with Blender, and I just started to figure out Fusion 360. Hoping to have a lot more custom designs, as of now I've only made a few, mostly simple, and mostly lost because I don't post them anywhere or even save them a lot of times. I use to be a digital hoarder, and after loosing a few projects I sort of went in the opposite direction and just don't even save most things, which is pretty dumb, especially since I've recently created a home network and can easily back up everything.

## Also learning markdown in mdx

I decided to use MDX for the blog pages since I've been wanting to learn (or memorize really) markdown. Astro's routing makes it super easy to format markdown pages and markdown seems the easiest to write anywhere, don't need to worry about coding. I can create a blog post from my phone or on any computer with basically any editor and then upload it. I went with MDX specifically becaues it allows a bit more customization over standard markdown, but it's (if I'm remembering correctly) basically stanard markdown.

I'm using [Astro Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus) as a base for this blog as it has a lot of the features I wanted to implement, pagination, Astro Image and such. It uses TailwindCSS which I've been wanting to learn as well. Also includes SEO which I really know nothing about so another thing to learn. At publishing of this site, it's basically just the stock theme, colors, logos, images changed, but I expect to make this a continuously evolving site as I learn more and integrate more.  

## More to come

My next big project that I will be working on is a custom Voron 0.2 build. The kit I got from Formbot, and got the parts printed with custom ABS from the Voron Print it Forward program. I bought custom frame and panels. I'm still trying to find either top hat frame in the custom colors, or PC 0.1 tophat panels so I can just print an extended 0.1 tophat, which I find a lot cuter. But we'll see, I'm not to worried about that part of it because I'll have a working printer either way, the fine details of the color customization can come later as the project evolves. I'm hoping to get pictures along the way and collect my thoughts on the process. I was saving for a Voron 2.4 but then I realized I could just get a Voron 0.2 now and then have the ability to print the parts needed when I eventually build a v2.4. I needed a larger printer for some of the keyboard projects I've been wanting to do (custom 3d printed cases) but smaller first seems like the ADHD thing to do first

That's all for now
